explanations:
siamese cats are really popular since they have a nice temper and pretty
coloring. however they're usually wanted as purebreeds, so they're expensive
to breed.
persian cats are pretty average cats.
maine coon cats are very friendly but not the prettiest, so they're probably
not being purchased as often and are being sold at a discount.
scottish folds are actually victims of a genetic disability/animal cruelty,
so they're very expensive in an attempt to discourage purchase, demand,
and by extension breeding.
ragdoll cats are also pretty average; just a random sale of ragdoll cats.
